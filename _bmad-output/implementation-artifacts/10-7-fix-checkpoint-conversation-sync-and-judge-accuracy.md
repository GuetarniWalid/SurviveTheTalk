## Story

As the **maintainer shipping the MVP**,
I want **the checkpoint judge to credit a beat only when the learner genuinely
accomplishes it, and the post-call debrief to show the score instantly with the
analysis filling in as soon as it is ready**,
so that **Story 10.6 (the Scout→gpt-4.1-mini migration that MUST ship before Groq
decommissions Scout on 2026-07-17) passes its Pixel 9 smoke gate and flips to
`done` — and the debrief never breaks on a timeout threshold again**.

## Context — why this story exists

Story 10.6 migrated all three LLM roles onto OpenAI `gpt-4.1-mini`. The migration
**code is correct and deployed** (`a82cbb4`). But the Pixel 9 smoke gate (call 340)
failed on two pre-existing, model-agnostic defects the precise gpt-4.1 model exposed.
They sent 10.6 back to `in-progress`. This story clears both.

Read `checkpoint-arc-rail-keeper-design-brief.md` `ADDENDUM (2026-06-29)` (§A judge,
§B debrief) for the authoritative framing — but note Bug B's fix is now the async
progressive design Walid chose, NOT the "raise the budget" the addendum sketched.

### Bug A evidence (waiter_easy_01, call 340) — the judge credits anything

| user turn | checkpoint credited | correct? |
|---|---|---|
| "Hi, good evening." | greet | ✅ |
| "I have the grilled chicken, please." | main_course **+ clarify (same turn)** | main ✅ / clarify ⚠️ premature |
| "a cola, please." | drink | ✅ |
| **"No other choice."** | **confirm** | ❌ not a confirmation |
| **"No other choice. Is it a question?"** | **close** | ❌ closes nothing |

Walid: *"je pouvais dire n'importe quoi, ça se déroule tout seul."* Root cause = the
criteria literally say "accept anything": `confirm` → *"Any acknowledgement of the
order summary counts"*; `close` → *"Even a simple 'okay' or 'thanks' counts."*
gpt-4.1-mini obeys them literally. Per `server/CLAUDE.md §8`: "easy" must forgive the
learner's **LANGUAGE**, not credit wrong/absent **content**. A confused / evasive /
tangential / question-back reply must be `unmet` at every difficulty.

### Bug B evidence (call 340) — the debrief never produces a real recap

```
11:47:33  call_ended call_id=340 reason=survived
11:47:45  debrief_generation failed (non-fatal): (ReadTimeout)
11:47:45  generation returned None → storing a degraded (score-only) debrief
11:47:46  GET /debriefs/340 → 200 OK     (client gets the degraded one)
```

Today the debrief is generated ONCE inside the bot teardown and frozen: if the LLM
call exceeds the budget, a degraded (score-only) row is stored and that is what the
client shows forever. Raising the budget only widens a fragile window. **The
structural fix is to decouple the two halves of the debrief** (see Dev Notes →
"Why progressive is the right fix").

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bug B — progressive debrief (do this track first; Walid wants real recaps back)

1. **Score persists instantly.** At call teardown, BEFORE awaiting the LLM, the bot
   persists a score-only debrief row marked `status = "pending"`. This row uses the
   EXISTING `degraded_core(reason)` + `assemble_debrief(...)` shape (survival %,
   checkpoints, attempt #, previous best, encouraging framing, the reason-pinned
   inappropriate-behavior) — but is NOT flagged `degraded` (it is "analysis still
   coming", not "analysis failed"). `GET /debriefs/{id}` returns it 200 immediately,
   so the client can render the full scorecard + checkpoints with ~no wait.
2. **Analysis fills in.** The bot then continues generating INLINE (it CANNOT
   background past process exit — see Dev Notes) with a generous budget sized to the
   measured gpt-4.1-mini debrief latency on the VPS (p99 + the one non-strict retry;
   measure with `probe_debrief_schema.py`). On success it UPDATEs the SAME row to
   `status = "ready"` with the full analysis blob. On terminal failure within the
   budget it marks the row `ready` + the existing in-blob `degraded` flag (the
   never-blank fallback — the user still keeps the score). Confirm
   `finish_reason != "length"` after any size/budget change.
3. **Persistence supports two phases.** A migration adds a `status` column to
   `debriefs` (recommended: `TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ready'`, values `pending` |
   `ready`; existing rows backfilled to `ready` for back-compat). A NEW
   `update_debrief_analysis(...)` query does the second write as an explicit UPDATE
   **guarded `WHERE status = 'pending'`** so a duplicate / late writer (Popen retry,
   pooled re-run) can neither clobber a completed blob nor resurrect a degraded one.
   The first write keeps `insert_debrief`'s `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` idempotency. The
   migration replays GREEN against `tests/fixtures/prod_snapshot.sqlite`
   (`test_migrations.py`); refresh the snapshot
   (`scripts/refresh_prod_snapshot.py`) so the new column is represented.
4. **The route signals readiness.** `GET /debriefs/{id}` surfaces `status` (or an
   equivalent `pending` flag) in the served envelope so the client can tell
   "score-only, analysis coming" from "ready" (full OR degraded). A row that does not
   yet exist still returns `DEBRIEF_NOT_READY` as today.
5. **The client renders progressively, never on a blind clock.** The debrief screen
   (`debrief_screen.dart`) shows the score + checkpoints the instant a payload parses
   (incl. a `pending` one), and:
   - adds a `_DebriefPhase.contentPending` and changes the terminal-on-first-content
     guard (line ~311) so a `pending` payload KEEPS polling instead of stopping;
   - merges a later fetch into the on-screen debrief (keep score/checkpoints, fill the
     empty analysis arrays; key list items by id so an open detail sheet doesn't go
     stale) and animates the analysis sections in;
   - stops polling on `ready` (full → show analysis; degraded → show the existing
     "detailed analysis unavailable" line);
   - extends the poll budget (today `kPollBudget = 30 s`) to cover the inline
     generation window so it never gives up while the row is still `pending`;
   - defers the Story 8.2 paywall-on-load (`presentPaywallOnLoad`) until the merge
     completes so the scrim doesn't cover the section-in animations;
   - decides the Story 9.1 cache behavior for a `pending` payload (re-fetch on
     report-icon re-open if the cached copy is still `pending`; do not cache a pending
     blob as final).
   `Debrief.tryParse` (`models/debrief.dart`) learns the `pending` flag.
6. **Verified on device.** A real on-device call shows the survival % + checkpoints
   within ~1–2 s and the analysis sections fill in afterward, with NO false "Debrief
   unavailable" and NO degraded fallback on a normal call.

### Bug A — judge accuracy via prompt + criteria + a fail-fast lint

7. `EXCHANGE_CLASSIFIER_MULTI_PROMPT` (`server/pipeline/prompts.py`) is STIFFENED so
   the judge credits a beat ONLY when the user GENUINELY accomplishes that specific
   goal. A non-committal / off-topic / "I don't know" / question-back / contentless
   reply is `unmet`, **even if a scenario's own criteria text is loosely worded** (add
   an explicit rule that a phrase like "any X counts" never licenses crediting
   empty/evasive/wrong content — the user must perform the actual move). Keep the
   INTENT-not-surface-form leniency (synonyms, fragments, "uh… the chicken") and the
   abuse section (R5) intact — Bug A is about *content*, not *language*.
8. The over-permissive `success_criteria` are rewritten across **ALL 6 shipped
   scenarios** to purge blanket-permissive license ("any … counts", "even a simple …
   counts", "any acknowledgement … counts", "any coherent … counts", "either way —
   pass it"). Each criterion states what GENUINELY satisfies the beat AND excludes the
   non-committal / off-topic / evasive reply (the landlord's existing "X counts; doing
   nothing does NOT count" pattern is the model). See Dev Notes for the per-file list.
9. **No over-correction into too-strict** (the §3c false-negative pole — wrongly
   marking a clearly-engaged turn `unmet`, which then drains patience and spirals the
   call). Criteria must still forgive B1 messy English, synonyms/brand names,
   fragments, and re-statements. Validated by the calibration band (AC12), not just
   the golden net.
10. A NEW fail-fast lint flags over-permissive criteria mechanically, mirroring the
    R1/R2 three-layer enforcement in `server/pipeline/scenarios.py`: a single
    source-of-truth helper (e.g. `find_permissive_criteria_phrases`) is (a) rejected
    HARD by `scenario_builder.validate_structure`, (b) WARNED by the loader, (c)
    asserted over the FULL `_SCENARIO_INDEX` glob by a new `tests/test_scenarios.py`
    lint that fails the commit — WITHOUT false-positiving on legitimate lenient prose.
    Write the rewritten criteria FIRST, then add the lint. Record it as **R8** in
    `server/CLAUDE.md §9`.

### Validation + gate (both bugs)

11. `python scripts/calibrate_scenario.py --golden-only` returns **6/6 PASS** (the
    universal off-topic seed is `unmet` on every beat of every scenario). The 10.6 D1
    sweep was 3/6 (fails: cop_hard_01, girlfriend_medium_01, mugger_medium_01 opening
    beats) — those must now pass.
12. A cooperative-learner sweep (`calibrate_scenario.py <id>`, default `--difficulty
    easy`) keeps each scenario's completion rate in the easy band (60–80, ±5 = ⚠️
    warning, still passes) — proving AC9. Bump `ENGINE_VERSION` in
    `calibration_engine.py` if the rules changed.
13. All automated gates green: server `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .` +
    `pytest` (incl. the new lint test, `test_scenarios.py`, `test_migrations.py`) AND
    client `flutter analyze` (No issues found!) + `flutter test` (All tests passed!) —
    the client now changes (progressive debrief screen).
14. Deployed to the VPS (migration auto-applies; DB backed up first) and the Pixel 9
    re-smoke PASSES: (a) "No other choice." to confirm/close is correctly NOT credited
    (the scenario does not play itself); (b) the debrief shows the score instantly and
    the analysis fills in (no degraded fallback on a normal call). This gate flips BOTH
    10.7 and 10.6 to `done`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 — Bug B server: two-phase debrief persistence (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)**
  - [x] Migration **017** (`017_debriefs_status.sql`): add
        `debriefs.status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ready'` (+ `CHECK(status IN
        ('pending','ready'))`); the DEFAULT backfills existing rows to `ready`.
        `test_migrations.py` replays GREEN against `prod_snapshot.sqlite` (+ a new
        `test_migration_017_debriefs_status`). Snapshot REFRESH is a post-deploy
        step (the ADD-only replay against the OLD snapshot is the meaningful test).
  - [x] `db/queries.py`: `insert_debrief` gained `status='ready'` (default, back-compat),
        the teardown first-write passes `status='pending'`; ADD
        `update_debrief_analysis(call_session_id, debrief_json, status='ready')` —
        an UPDATE guarded `WHERE status='pending'` (can't clobber a ready blob).
  - [x] `pipeline/debrief_teardown.py::persist_debrief`: reordered — the idempotency
        claim + the score-only `pending` insert run BEFORE `generate_debrief`; then
        generation awaits inline (generous budget); on success UPDATE → `ready` + full
        blob; on failure (or a contract-failing blob) UPDATE → `ready` + in-blob
        `degraded` (never-blank kept). Idempotency claim + `upsert_user_progress`
        transaction preserved.
  - [x] `pipeline/debrief_generator.py`: inline budget raised 7.5/14 → 25/55 s (the
        INLINE cap, not a client deadline); `probe_debrief_schema.py` now TIMES the
        live call + prints `finish_reason` so the VPS smoke gate can confirm p99 fits.
  - [x] `api/routes_debriefs.py` + `models/schemas.py` (`DebriefOut`): the route injects
        `pending` (from the `status` COLUMN) into the 200 envelope; a missing row still
        → `DEBRIEF_NOT_READY`.
- [x] **Task 2 — Bug B client: progressive merge (AC: 5, 6)**
  - [x] `models/debrief.dart`: `tryParse` learns the `pending` flag (+ a `copyWith`).
  - [x] `views/debrief_screen.dart`: added `_DebriefPhase.contentPending`; the terminal
        guard now only stops on terminal `content`, so `pending` KEEPS polling; the ready
        fetch merges in (a quiet "Analyzing…" placeholder replaces the empty analysis
        sections while pending, then the analysis fades in); `kPollBudget` 30 → 90 s;
        the Story 8.2 paywall is DEFERRED until the terminal merge; budget-exhaust →
        score-only degraded terminal (never blank).
  - [x] `views/call_ended_screen.dart`: confirmed the overlay hands off the `pending`
        payload (debrief screen keeps polling); it now SKIPS caching a pending blob.
  - [x] Story 9.1 cache: a `pending` blob is never cached as final; the READY analysis is
        cached from `DebriefScreen` once it lands; a cached pending blob (defensive) re-polls.
- [x] **Task 3 — Bug A: stiffen the judge prompt (AC: 7)** — `prompts.py` principle 7 +
      a reminder after the goals block: a permissive criterion never licenses crediting
      empty/evasive/off-topic/question-back content.
- [x] **Task 4 — Bug A: rewrite the 6 scenarios' over-permissive `success_criteria` (AC: 8, 9)**
      — purged every blanket catch-all across waiter/cop/girlfriend/mugger/landlord; each
      rewritten criterion states the genuine move + a "does NOT count" exclusion (the
      landlord model). cop_interrogation untouched (its hit is a base_prompt rule).
- [x] **Task 5 — Bug A: add the permissiveness lint R8 (AC: 10)** — `scenarios.py`
      `find_permissive_criteria_phrases` + builder HARD reject + loader WARN +
      `test_scenarios.py` glob lint + `server/CLAUDE.md §9` (R8).
- [x] **Task 6 — Re-validate (AC: 13 green; AC: 11, 12 owed on the VPS)** — server
      `ruff`/`format`/`pytest` **1051** + client `flutter analyze` clean + `flutter test`
      **701** all GREEN (incl. the new migration / lint / criteria-regression / progressive
      tests). The LIVE golden 6/6 (AC11) + cooperative band (AC12) need the OpenAI key →
      run **on the VPS** (Smoke Test Gate boxes) — not runnable locally.
- [ ] **Task 7 — Deploy + smoke gate (AC: 14)** — the review→done gate: DB backup, deploy,
      run the VPS golden sweep + probe, fill the Smoke Test Gate boxes, Pixel 9 (script in
      Dev Notes → Smoke script). Owned by the reviewer (deploy) + Walid (device).

## Dev Notes

### Order of work
Bug B (progressive debrief) and Bug A (judge) are INDEPENDENT — do them as two tracks,
converging on one deploy + one Pixel 9 re-smoke. Start with Bug B (Walid wants real
recaps back).

### Bug B — why PROGRESSIVE, not "raise the timeout" (Walid's 2026-06-29 call)
Raising the budget only widens a fragile window; the debrief still races a deadline.
The structural fix splits the debrief's two halves:
- **Score half** (survival %, checkpoints, attempt #, previous best, framing,
  reason-pinned inappropriate-behavior) — BACKEND-computed, available at teardown with
  NO LLM. `degraded_core(reason)` + `assemble_debrief(..., degraded=True)` ALREADY
  produce exactly this blob (it is what teardown persists today on an LLM failure). So
  the instant score-only payload needs ZERO new assembly — just written EARLIER, marked
  `pending` instead of `degraded`.
- **Analysis half** (errors, idioms, areas, better_phrasings, hesitation contexts) —
  LLM-generated, slow. Arrives via the second (UPDATE) write.

### Bug B — the ONE hard limit (be honest about it)
The transcript + analysis exist ONLY inside the per-call bot subprocess, which runs
`asyncio.run(run_bot(...))` and EXITS the moment teardown returns (`bot.py` ~1052
pooled / ~1078 cold-spawn). A fire-and-forget `asyncio.create_task` that outlives
teardown is IMPOSSIBLE — `asyncio.run` closes the loop and cancels pending tasks. So
the second write MUST happen **inline** in the same teardown: write score-only → keep
blocking to finish generation → UPDATE → exit. The bot already runs teardown to
completion with no deadline-kill (verified), so a longer inline generation is safe;
pooled bots are single-use so this doesn't starve a worker. **Consequence:** "truly
unbounded / no threshold ever" is NOT achievable without moving generation off the bot
(persist the transcript + a separate always-on worker) — which reverses the Story 7.1
"never persist the transcript" privacy decision and is OUT of scope. The deliverable is
"instant score + a generous inline window for the analysis", which removes the
CLIENT-side false-unavailable and the perceived wait — not literal infinity. Size the
inline budget to measured p99 + one retry; do NOT pick "60 s to be safe".

### Bug B — exact seams (from the codebase investigation)
- `pipeline/debrief_teardown.py::persist_debrief` (~lines 89–251) — the teardown
  orchestration; reorder here (score-only insert BEFORE `generate_debrief`, UPDATE
  after). Keep the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` idempotency claim on `call_sessions` +
  `upsert_user_progress`.
- `pipeline/debrief_generator.py` — `generate_debrief` (~652) outer budget + `_generate`
  HTTP budget become the INLINE cap; `degraded_core` (~575) IS the score-only core.
- `pipeline/debrief_assembly.py::assemble_debrief` (~119–177) — `degraded=True` adds the
  in-blob flag; reuse for the score-only `pending` blob but DON'T set `degraded` (pending
  ≠ failed).
- `db/queries.py` — `insert_debrief` (~517, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) is the first write;
  add `update_debrief_analysis(... WHERE status='pending')` for the second.
- `db/migrations/011_debriefs.sql` is the current schema (no status column; `degraded`
  lives INSIDE `debrief_json`). New migration adds `status`.
- `api/routes_debriefs.py` (~30–84) — returns the stored dict verbatim; add `status`/
  `pending` to the envelope. `DEBRIEF_NOT_READY` (no row) unchanged.
- Client: `views/debrief_screen.dart` (state machine `_DebriefPhase` ~217, the terminal
  guard ~311, `kPollBudget` ~224), `models/debrief.dart` (`tryParse` + `degraded` ~271 →
  add `pending`), `views/call_ended_screen.dart` (the prefetch handoff ~303–340 — verify
  it hands off a pending payload), `repositories/call_repository.dart::fetchDebrief`
  (unchanged).

### Bug B — race + back-compat guards (don't skip)
- The second write is an UPDATE guarded `WHERE status='pending'` so a Popen-retry /
  pooled re-run can't clobber a `ready` blob or resurrect a degraded one.
- Migration backfills existing rows → `ready` and replays green against
  `prod_snapshot.sqlite` (Story 5.1 lesson: an empty test DB proves nothing) — refresh
  the snapshot so the new column is represented.
- Client merge keys list items by id so an open error/area detail sheet doesn't go stale
  when a later fetch replaces the list; lock scroll during section-in animations.

### Bug A — the judge prompt
`EXCHANGE_CLASSIFIER_MULTI_PROMPT` (`prompts.py` ~286) already says "Default to UNMET"
and "don't credit just because the user engaged", but a beat's own loosely-worded
`success_criteria` (injected via `{pending_goals_block}`) overrides that. Add an
explicit clause: the criteria describe the TARGET; a permissive phrasing never licenses
crediting empty/evasive/off-topic/wrong content — the user must perform the actual move.
Keep INTENT-not-surface leniency + the abuse section (R5).

### Bug A — the criteria to rewrite (per file, under `server/pipeline/scenarios/`)
Touch ONLY over-permissive `success_criteria`.
- **the-waiter.yaml** (call-340 culprit): `confirm` (~191–194 "Any acknowledgement of
  the order summary counts") + `close` (~203–205 "Even a simple 'okay' or 'thanks'
  counts") are worst; also review `clarify` (~146–159) + `drink` (~175–182 "either way —
  pass it"). Require the actual move (confirm = affirms OR corrects the SPECIFIC order;
  close = a real closing courtesy), keep synonym/refusal acceptance.
- **the-cop.yaml** (cop_hard_01 — golden FAIL): ~80, 99, 113 ("Any coherent
  justification counts"), 150. Tighten the opening react/respond.
- **the-girlfriend.yaml** (girlfriend_medium_01 — golden FAIL): ~107, 175.
- **the-mugger.yaml** (mugger_medium_01 — golden FAIL): ~82 ("Any coherent response
  counts"), 144 ("Any firm closing statement counts").
- **the-landlord.yaml** (landlord_hard_01 — golden PASS): ~80, 102, 118, 133, 148, 163 —
  the GOOD MODEL ("X counts; ignoring/doing-nothing does NOT count"); propagate its shape.
- **cop-interrogation-01.yaml** (golden PASS): the line-36 hit is a `base_prompt` rule,
  NOT a `success_criteria` — leave it.

### Bug A — the lint (R8, mirror R1/R2)
Source of truth in `scenarios.py` (alongside `find_model_specific_tokens` ~425 /
`find_scripting_violations` ~463). Three layers: builder HARD reject + loader WARN +
`tests/test_scenarios.py` over the `_SCENARIO_INDEX` glob (never a hand-list). Candidate
flags (tune for zero false-positives AFTER the rewrite): `any acknowledgement`, `even a
simple`, `any coherent … counts`, `either way — pass it`, a bare `any … counts`. Don't
trip on legitimate lenient prose ("Accept … common synonyms", "re-stating … counts").
Record R8 in `server/CLAUDE.md §9`.

### Bug A — the swing is ONE defect (AC9)
Brief §3c is the opposite pole: a false-NEGATIVE ("I would like to know if it is possible
to order?" judged `greet: unmet`) drains −15 patience/turn → 100→40 in ~50 s → hang-up.
The rewrite must reject empty/off-topic content WITHOUT marking a clearly-engaged messy-
B1 turn `unmet`. The calibration band (AC12) is the proof. The patience↔judge DECOUPLING
itself is OUT of scope (10-8); just don't make it worse.

### Constraints / what must NOT be broken (brief §10 + server/CLAUDE.md)
- **Judge timeouts** `_CLASSIFIER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 4.5` / `_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 4.0`
  in `exchange_classifier.py` — LEAVE them (the 10.6 review measured the judge ~2 s/call
  and restored these). Bug B touches the DEBRIEF budgets, a DIFFERENT pair (brief §10
  calls this out).
- **`VERDICT_WAIT_BUDGET_MS` (800 ms)** + felt-timing calibration — off-limits.
- **Strict structured output** — judge stays strict `json_schema`; debrief keeps strict +
  the non-strict-400 retry. Don't touch the schema shapes (`server/CLAUDE.md §4`).
- **`requires` / `implies` crediting semantics** — unchanged; tightening criteria text is
  independent of the gating engine.
- **golden==prod parity** + the **R1–R7 rulebook** (extend with R8, don't bypass).
- **Story 7.1 "never persist the transcript"** — the progressive design keeps the
  transcript in the bot; it does NOT persist it server-side.

### Scope boundary (DEFERRED to 10-8, not this story)
Brief §1–9: HUD stale-instruction sync, arc-ordering character conduct, the
patience↔judge false-negative decoupling. This story is judge-accuracy + progressive-
debrief ONLY.

### Smoke script (hand Walid a ready-to-play one at Task 7)
Cover BOTH money moments in one or two calls on **The Waiter**: (a) order normally, then
when she reads the order back, answer with a non-answer like "No other choice." — the
`confirm`/`close` checkpoints must NOT tick (HUD holds); (b) after the call, the debrief
shows the survival % + checkpoints immediately, then the language analysis appears a few
seconds later (no "unavailable", no score-only-only). Then a clean run that completes
all beats to confirm a genuine confirm/close still credits.

## Project Structure Notes

- Server: a DB migration (status column) + two-phase teardown + new UPDATE query + route
  signal + the judge prompt + 6 scenarios' criteria + a lint helper & its 3 wiring
  points + a CLAUDE.md rule. Deploys via the normal CI deploy-server path; the migration
  auto-applies (back up first).
- Client now CHANGES (progressive debrief screen + model flag) → Flutter gates apply.
- The score-only payload reuses the existing `degraded_core`/`assemble_debrief` shape —
  no new assembly code, only a new `status` lifecycle around it.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

claude-opus-4-8 (Claude Opus 4.8)

### Debug Log References

- Server gates: `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .` clean; `pytest` → **1051 passed**
  (incl. `test_migrations` replaying migration 017 against `prod_snapshot.sqlite`, the new
  R8 lint glob, the criteria-regression nets, and the two-phase teardown/queries/routes tests).
- Client gates: `flutter analyze` → No issues found!; `flutter test` → **701 passed** (incl.
  the new progressive-debrief screen tests + the pending-handoff overlay test).
- One client a11y test surfaced the `Opacity(0)` semantics-drop on the analysis fade-in →
  fixed with `alwaysIncludeSemantics: true` (a screen reader must read the analysis throughout).

### Completion Notes List

**Bug B — progressive debrief (server + client).** The debrief is now two-phase. At teardown
the bot claims idempotency, persists a SCORE-ONLY `pending` row (reusing
`degraded_core`/`assemble_debrief`, NOT flagged `degraded`), then generates the analysis INLINE
and UPDATEs the SAME row → `ready` (guarded `WHERE status='pending'`). `GET /debriefs/{id}`
returns the scorecard instantly with `pending:true`; the client renders the score + checkpoints
at once, shows a quiet "Analyzing…" placeholder (never the empty "No errors flagged" sections),
keeps polling, then fades the analysis in. Never-blank preserved on every failure path (timeout,
terminal HTTP error, contract-failing blob, or client budget-exhaust → score-only degraded).
The inline budget (25/55 s) is the only "threshold" left and it no longer races a client clock.

**Bug A — judge accuracy.** `EXCHANGE_CLASSIFIER_MULTI_PROMPT` gained principle 7 (a
permissive-sounding criterion never licenses crediting empty/evasive/off-topic/question-back
content — the user must perform the move; difficulty forgives LANGUAGE not CONTENT). All 6
scenarios' over-permissive `success_criteria` were rewritten to the landlord model (state the
genuine move + a "does NOT count" exclusion); the call_id=340 beats (`confirm`/`close`) now
explicitly reject "No other choice." / "Is it a question?". New R8 lint
(`find_permissive_criteria_phrases`) enforces this by construction: builder HARD reject + loader
WARN + a `test_scenarios.py` glob over the full index, tuned for zero false-positives on the
rewrites + cop_interrogation (server/CLAUDE.md §9 R8).

**OWED before `done` (the review→done gate, NOT runnable in this dev session):**
1. `/bmad-code-review` by a DIFFERENT LLM (Opus 4.8 implemented this).
2. Deploy to the VPS (DB backup first; migration 017 auto-applies) + refresh `prod_snapshot`.
3. VPS live validation (needs the OpenAI key, absent locally):
   `calibrate_scenario.py --golden-only` → 6/6 PASS; a cooperative `easy` band sweep stays in
   60–80; `probe_debrief_schema.py` times one live debrief (`finish_reason != "length"`, budget
   covers p99). Bump `ENGINE_VERSION` if the band sweep shows the rules drifted.
4. **Pixel 9 smoke gate (Walid)** — clearing it flips BOTH 10.7 and 10.6 → `done`.

**Ready-to-play Pixel 9 script (The Waiter, easy):**
- Open **The Waiter**. Order normally: say **"Hi, good evening."** → **"I'll have the grilled
  chicken, please."** → (she asks grilled/fried — answer) → **"A cola, please."**
- 💰 **Money moment A (judge):** when she reads the order back and asks you to confirm, answer
  **"No other choice."** then **"No other choice. Is it a question?"** — the `confirm` and `close`
  checkpoints must NOT tick (HUD holds). *(Then give a real confirm — "Yes, that's right." — and
  a real close — "Thanks." — so a genuine confirm/close still credits.)*
- 💰 **Money moment B (debrief):** after the call ends, the survival % + checkpoints appear within
  ~1–2 s, then the language-analysis sections fill in a few seconds later — NO "Debrief unavailable",
  NO degraded "analysis unavailable" on this normal call.

### Change Log

- 2026-06-29 — dev-story 10.7: Bug B progressive debrief (migration 017 + two-phase teardown +
  `pending` route signal + progressive debrief screen) and Bug A judge accuracy (prompt
  principle 7 + 6 scenarios' criteria rewritten + R8 permissiveness lint). All automated gates
  green (server pytest 1051; client analyze + 701). Status → review. Owed: code review (diff LLM)
  + deploy + VPS golden/probe + Pixel 9 smoke (the review→done gate, which also flips 10.6).
